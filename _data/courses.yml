    - review: The course was structured well with no distraction from countless dependency modules. The use of vanilla JavasScript enabled me to focused on key Electron API features.
      user: Willie J Bernard
    - review: I really enjoyed this course. It is the most in-depth electron course I have seen. It was straight forward, well enunciated and understandable. I especially enjoyed the automatic updating and release manage section. It also was a great introduction to the MAC touchbar. All in all, I will be happy to take other course from him as the needs arise.

    - review: Ray is a fantastic teacher, and although yarn isn't very hard to understand (especially if you are familiar with npm), he explains things very well and point out details which you might miss in the official docs. Especially useful (to me) was the workflow to test packages without publishing them on the npm registry.
      user: Bruno Belotti
    - review: I was able to watch the whole course at one time. It rarely happens to me, so it means the course is very interesting and the topics are much absorbing. I'm very satisfied.
