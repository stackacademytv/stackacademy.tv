      <p>I’m Ray.</p>

      <p>At age 31, I’ve changed careers more times than most people will in a lifetime.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more interesting include: apprentice mechanic at a</span><a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/SuperbikeSolutions/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really cool motorcycle
            shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, designer &amp; builder of commercial marine aquariums, manager at
          a health &amp; fitness club (and a restaurant, come to think of it) and of course, software developer. The list goes
          on.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love change and I’m always up for ditching the old and starting from scratch. This
          approach has turned me into a bit of a serial learner, and I now work as a remote developer for a UK-based software
          company, whilst living in a</span><a

          <span style="font-weight: 400;">small coastal town</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in sunny South Africa.
          – Exactly as I envisioned it years ago.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve always enjoyed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing</span></i><span
          style="font-weight: 400;"> people how to do stuff, whether that be teaching the local cub-scouts to build JavaScript
          robots, or simply showing my mom how to read the tube map.</span></p>

          <p>In 2015 the idea of being able to help people learn new skills, coupled with a new-found interest in video
        production, got me very interested in the idea of producing my own online courses.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a ton of self-taught skills, a genuine love for programming and I knew how to
          learn – quick!</span></p>

          <p>I published my first course a few months later and slowly but surely the positive feedback started coming in.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was hooked!</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online courses not only allowed me to teach </span><i><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn, but my content was bringing
          genuine value to people all around the world – and so Stackacademy.tv was born.</span></p>

          <p>Stackacademy.tv is more than a website with a few courses, it’s where I want to help you learn something of value in
        the most concise and enjoyable format possible.</p>

        <p>I’m constantly working on better ways to deliver my content and specifically design my courses to be more than
        verbose tutorials, but rather re-usable nuggets with a clear beginning, middle and end.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to <a href="https://stackacademy.tv/contact/">contact me</a> anytime with questions, suggestions or just to say <em>Hello</em>.</p>
      <p>Always here to help.<br><strong>Ray Viljoen</strong></p>
