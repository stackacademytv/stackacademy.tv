<strong>On a recent episode of <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tim Ferris Show</a>, #177 to be exact, Tim played a follow up Q&amp;A session from a previous podcast with Seth Godin and, as always, Seth’s insights were simply priceless.</strong>

If you’re not familiar with Seth Godin, I’d highly recommend you Google “Seth” and also <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribe to his blog</a>. It’s the number one Google result for a reason.

I’ve since listened to the episode 3 more times and whilst taking notes for myself, thought it a good opportunity to share my summary of what Seth discussed. This one is completely Tim-free, which is unusual, but nonetheless one of the most information-dense podcasts ever. Helpful, practical information.

<small>* Please note, unless explicitly stated, I am not quoting Seth Godin, but rather relaying what I took from him. I aim to be as accurate as possible throughout.</small>

<h3><span style="color: #dddddd;">The Podcast Summary:</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before starting with the first question, Seth talks about the the meaning of true connection via the information put out by Tim.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this opening he kicks off with a poster-worthy statement for any service-driven business.</span></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0377b1;"><i><b>" Real connection comes from people who seek to contribute to the community first. "</b></i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is so important, and even though we hear all the time that </span><span class="s2"><i>“serving is key”</i></span><span class="s1">, we often forget what this means.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do at least. Maybe as a result of hearing it so often. Putting the community first and contributing with it’s needs as the number one priority, is what builds trust.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Genuine trust in your brand. You.</span></p>

</div>
<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> What’s the one thing that most marketers do wrong ?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest, and most common, mistake is selfish, narcissistic behaviour. This put’s the marketer’s wants &amp; needs first and, in doing so, interrupts/spams users. This behaviour is easy to justify &amp; rationalise as they are playing the short game.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Successful marketers, the minority, don’t do this. They play the long game. Building a story/product that spreads because it’s remarkable and of value.
Real connection by contributing to their tribe </span><span class="s2">(following/community)</span><span class="s1"> first.</span></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>How do I build a tribe from scratch?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that we have to build a tribe is wrong. Nike and Harley Davidson did not build their tribes, they simply service existing tribes of runners and bikers respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To find your tribe you simply need to be able to define <i>this</i> in the context of:
</span><span style="color: #0377b1;"><span class="s1"><i>“People like us do things like </i></span><span class="s2"><i>this</i></span></span><span class="s1"><i><span style="color: #0377b1;">”</span>
</i></span><span class="s1">If you can define <i>this,</i> then you know who your tribe is.</span></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>What limiting self-beliefs did Seth overcome, and how?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As human beings we are programmed to avoid things at which we might be unsuccessful, incompetent etc. This is a form of fear and it often puts us in a sour mindset.
</span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><i>“Why should I even bother?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result of this natural risk-avoidance (primal danger), we tend to keep track of our failures, rejections and heartbreaks, rather than our successes, risks-taken and people influenced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all adds-up to limiting, fear-based, self-beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By making a conscious effort to track our successes, we can transform our self-image to a person capable of impacting the world in a positive way. Regardless of how many times we fail. Failures can also be defined as risks-taken.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;">Your own personal narrative isn’t something that’s done to you, it’s something you choose.</span></strong></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>Opinion on Quality vs Quantity in the age of the Hustle obsessed? Can you win <u>not</u> being everywhere?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course you can. The real question is:
</span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><i>“Can you win being everywhere?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one is everywhere. Most people have never heard of you, Seth, Tim etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of being everywhere is a trap.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A place to hide from failure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a trap that seeks to dilute, distribute and suck our content away from us in return for a ‘Like’ or a little heart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Always ask yourself:
</span><span style="color: #0377b1;"><span class="s1"><i>“What’s the smallest possible footprint I can get away with?”
</i></span><span class="s1"><i>”What’s the smallest group of people I can help?”</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Smaller</i> is achievable, yet more risky. It allows us to fail quickly, whereas the bigger, almost infinite, idea of being everywhere gives us a place to hide from failure.</span></p>

<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i><b>The internet is filled with "shortcuts", "life hacks” as such. About the "Long-cut"</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shortcuts hardly ever work. The 'long-cut', or long term game, is almost always the most direct route to getting where you want to be. It is the Beatles playing Hamburg for months. </span><span class="s2">* Remember Outliers. 10,000 hours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This again comes back to the opening statement of:
</span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><i>“Real connection comes from people who seek to contribute to the community first.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always about what the tribe/community needs first. It’s not give and get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #0377b1;"><strong><span class="s1">The difficult part is doing work that matters. Not tricks &amp; shortcuts. </span><span class="s1">Play the Long-cut.</span></strong></span></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>Opinions on schooling and Seth’s Alt-MBA</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public schooling is an artefact of the industrial age. It produces factory workers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being able to say </span><span class="s2" style="color: #0377b1;"><i>“I can do this. Now pay me”</i></span><span class="s3"><i>,</i></span><span class="s1"> is being replaced by:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A. People capable of solving interesting problems. Problems that cannot be ‘Googled’ or automated.</span><span class="s5"> (automation referring to the ability of solving the problem, not the solution itself.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">B. People that can lead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents should embrace the idea of ‘free-range kids’. The lessons we remember is the ones learnt the hard way. Encourage kids to find things that don’t work or that they aren’t good at. By figuring it out they learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Apply this idea to serving your tribe and what becomes key is ‘enrolment’. People need to embrace your work for themselves.</span></p>

<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i><b>Do you experience fear and how do you overcome it?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear </span><span class="s2">NEVER</span><span class="s1"> stops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is hardwired into us and kept our ancestors alive, but lately, it is often incorrectly processed. e.g. Public speaking. There is nothing inherently dangerous about public speaking, but if <i>feels</i> dangerous. It’s a bug in our operating systems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The large majority of us cannot make this fear go away, but we can dance with the fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We simply </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">don’t</span></span><span class="s1"> need to overcome it, rather recognise and understand it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we learn to associate fear with producing meaningful work, we can do exactly this and once we understand this process we can use fear to gauge the quality of our work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Ask yourself: </span><em><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;">“Why is this making me nervous?”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nervousness is often pointing you where you should go.</span></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>How would you make an impact today?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raising money is being touted as a goal. The definition of success. In reality, it’s only postponing the day where the company asks the customer for money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teach one person. Change one person. The smallest footprint.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Serving a bigger audience, with money raised, isn’t more difficult. It’s the same. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies need to learn to communicate with their customers in order to recognise the solution they can offer. Learning the long-cut.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose is always to create value for a person that can pay you again and again.</span></p>

<h4><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i style="line-height: 1.5;"><b>What’s your Personal brand?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Humans don’t have logos. Your brand is the promise you make. Implicitly and explicitly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brands that keep their promises earn trust and awareness. You are your own brand and you cannot escape it. The best time to start working on your brand is 5 years ago, or if you haven’t, the next best time is NOW.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your brand is the story you help people tell themselves, about you. Everything about you influences this story and most of it is unfair and fear-based, but you can help them with this story by creating expectations and by being authentic.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Be a</span><span class="s1"><i> </i><span style="color: #0377b1;"><b>meaningful specific</b></span></span><span class="s2"> not a </span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><b>wandering generality</b></span><span class="s2">.</span></p>

<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i><b>How do I decide what is essential, indispensable or useless?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decide what the change is that your trying to make.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do not allow the mainstream to opinion to push you towards average.
</span><span class="s1">Great brands are built around the edges and if you decide to play here, you need to accept what comes with the territory.</span></p>

<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i><b>On the Gig-economy.</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Desire for the new eats it’s own young.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the new gig-economy, you simply have to be better. Go the extra mile.
When you know your customer better than your competition, they will choose you every time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can take responsibility of your work by making it more human and this will resonate with the customer.</span></p>

<h4><i><b><span style="color: #ff403d;">•</span> </b></i><i><b>How to pick projects?</b></i></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is important to decide who you are and what scale you want to be.
</span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><b>Self-awareness.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simply ask yourself:
</span><span class="s1" style="color: #0377b1;"><i>“Does this help my customers and does it move me closer towards the change I want to make in the community.”</i></span></p>
