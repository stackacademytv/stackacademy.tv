**An invaluable skill for any developer looking to future-proof their skills**

WebAssembly is the most promising new technology for the web, allowing browsers, and other JavaScript environments, to run blazing-fast raw binary modules, compiled directly from C, C++ and many other languages.

Understanding WebAssembly is an invaluable skill for anyone working with JavaScript or compiled languages, allowing you to bridge the gap between native software development and web-based JavaScript.

This course will provide a very practical and concise approach to learning WebAssembly & Emscripten, and will give you a solid base to immediately start creating and implementing fast, optimised WebAssembly modules.

#### Course Content:

This course aims to teach a solid foundational understanding of what WebAssembly is, and why it's so powerful.

**Section one** starts with an overview of WebAssembly and a detailed setup lesson to help you follow along every step of the way.

**Section two** covers the native JavaScript browser API for loading and running WebAssembly modules. This section also includes importing and exporting functions to and from a WebAssembly module, and shows how to access WebAssembly memory.

**The third** and most substantial part of the course, covers Emscripten in-depth. Teaching everything from installing Emscripten on either Mac, Windows or Linux, compiling C code from scratch and the general Module runtime cycle.

This Emscripten section also teaches some more advanced features of Emscripten, including calling JavaScript from a WebAssembly module and vice-versa.

**The final section** of the course is a practical 4-part lesson, teaching how to implement a fully animated HTML5 Canvas project using WebAssembly as the main processor.

**Upon completion of this course you will have the practical skills to immediately start creating high performance WebAssembly modules.**

This course is to the point and everything is demonstrated in the most simple, yet practical ways.
