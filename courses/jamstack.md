**An invaluable skill for any Web Developer**

JAMStack is modern web stack that solves many of the problems associated with traditional server-side (monolithic) architectures used for most web-based projects.

Learning to shift from traditional stacks to a modern stack, like JAMStack, is an essential skill for any developer working on web-based projects.

This course will provide a very practical and concise approach to understanding every aspect of the JAMStack and will enable you to start creating custom solutions for any given project, or incrementally migrate existing projects to a JAMStack.

#### Course Content:

With dedicated sections for each part of the JAM stack, this course aims to teach you how to think and work in terms of a JAMStack.

The focus of the course is the architecture itself, rather than focusing on specific solutions and is suitable for anyone with basic web-development and Git knowledge.

The course starts by covering all the concepts specific to a JAMStack and demonstrates the function of each layer of the stack.

Thereafter the "Markup" part of the stack is covered with some in-depth explanations and an introduction to the HUGO static site generator. Teaching you how to install, configure and compile static sites.

The course then builds on this by explaining how to add dynamic functionality to a static site by means of JavaScript APIs. Including the use of cloud functions and self-hosted API services.

Next you'll learn to create a completely automated build and deploy process using either GitHub Actions or an all-in-one solution like Netlify.

With finally a dedicated section on how to integrate a headless CMS into a static site.

**Upon completion of this course, you will not only understand the specific solutions covered in the lessons, but also have a broad understanding of how to build sites and apps using the core principles of a JAMStack.**

The entire course is to the point and will teach you the entirety of the JAMStack architecture in the shortest amount of time possible!
